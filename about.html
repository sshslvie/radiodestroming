<div id="ABOUT">
<p><h4>Station de Stroming<h4><h5>
is at once a nomadic web radio station and a journalistic platform, conceived in Rotterdam and presently based in France. This station functions as a tool to design a series of conversations about and encounters, interrogating and revealing the current socio-political, legal context in which it is situated, as well as they ways in which this can be re-imagined.
<br><br> 
The Dutch <i>stroming</i> translates to ‘the current’ and ‘ideological movement’. <br>A tension between water and time.</p>
